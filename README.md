# 🌾 Harvest Hub – AI-Driven Agricultural Insights

**Harvest Hub** is a full-stack AI-powered web platform designed to help farmers make informed, data-driven agricultural decisions. By combining machine learning and computer vision techniques, the platform delivers real-time insights for:

* ✅ **Crop Recommendation**
* 📈 **Crop Yield Prediction**
* 🍂 **Plant Disease Detection**

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌱 Crop Recommendation

Recommends the most suitable crop based on environmental and soil parameters such as NPK levels, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
→ **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
→ **Accuracy**: \~96%

### 📊 Yield Prediction

Estimates the expected yield for a selected crop using historical and environmental data.
→ **Model**: Decision Tree Regression
→ **Accuracy**: \~85%

### 🩺 Plant Disease Detection

Detects plant diseases from leaf images using a Transformer-based deep learning model.
→ **Model**: Vision Transformer (ViT)
→ **Training Data**: 87,000+ images
→ **Accuracy**: \~92%

## 💡 Motivation

With agriculture being the backbone of many economies, **Harvest Hub** aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence and cloud computing to assist farmers in making smarter choices. Our goal is to build tools that are:

* Accurate
* Scalable
* Easy to use
* Impactful in real-world agricultural scenarios

This project was developed as part of an academic initiative to explore how AI can address practical challenges in farming and food production.
